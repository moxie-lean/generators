# yo lean:new-wp

> Generates the config we need for a WordPress project.

To run this command just type on the terminal: 

```bash
yo moxie-lean:new-wp
```

You need to set-up the remote repo first on GitHub or Bitbucket.

This generator creates: 

- A composer.json file
- A default .gitignore file
- A .travis.yml file to set up CI.

It then initialises Git and pushes to your remote repo.
