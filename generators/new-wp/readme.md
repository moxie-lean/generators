# yo moxie-lean:new-wp

> Generates a new WordPress plugin.

To run this command just type on the terminal: 

```bash
yo moxie-lean:new-wp
```

It will prompt you for the project name and github/bitbucket repo uri. Note that the plugin will take the same name as the project. You should use a lowercase name separated with -'s.
